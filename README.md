# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-with-MySQL

# Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of Walmart sales data using MySQL. The aim is to gain insights into various aspects of Walmart's operations, including product performance, sales trends, customer behavior, and branch performance. This analysis is conducted using SQL queries to extract and interpret the data.

# Objectives
Understand Top Performing Branches: Identify which branches perform best in terms of sales.
Analyze Product Performance: Determine which product lines are selling the most and which are least popular.
Customer Behavior Insights: Investigate how customer types and payment methods affect sales.
Gender Distribution: Analyze the distribution of customers by gender and their purchasing behavior.
Time-of-Day Sales Analysis: Understand the sales patterns throughout different times of the day and week.
Value Added Tax (VAT) Analysis: Evaluate how VAT and other taxes impact sales.

# Data Source
The data used in this project is from the Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition available at Kaggle.

# Recommendations
Focus on Evening Sales: Given that sales are highest during the evening, consider running promotions or offering discounts during this time to further boost sales.
Improve Branch B Performance: Branch B lags behind in both sales and customer ratings. Investigate and address the underlying issues to improve its performance.
Target Gender-Specific Marketing: Since the gender distribution varies by branch, tailor marketing strategies to better appeal to the predominant gender at each branch.
Enhance Customer Experience on Mondays: Given that Monday has the highest ratings, ensure that the quality of service remains high throughout the week to maintain customer satisfaction.
Optimize Product Mix: Focus on promoting and stocking more of the top-performing product lines (fashion accessories, food and beverages) to drive sales.
